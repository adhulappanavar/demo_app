Bundler could not find compatible versions for gem "activesupport":
  In snapshot (Gemfile.lock):
    activesupport (4.0.1)

  In Gemfile:
    rails (= 4.0.2) x86-mingw32 depends on
      activesupport (= 4.0.2) x86-mingw32

Running `bundle update` will rebuild your snapshot from scratch, using only
the gems in your Gemfile, which may resolve the conflict.
